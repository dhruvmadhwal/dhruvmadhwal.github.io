        Hi! I'm a Graduate Researcher at the <a href="https://coral-lab-asu.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoRAL Lab</a> at ASU. My work focuses on information retrieval, agentic LLM architectures, and large scale information synchronization.

        <div class="flex justify-between items-baseline gap-2 mt-8">
          <span class="font-bold text-[2rem]">Multi‑Hop Reasoning Agent — CoRAL Lab, ASU</span>
          <span class="font-bold text-[2rem] whitespace-nowrap">Feb 2025–Present</span>
        </div>
        Building a model‑agnostic multi‑hop QA agent for open‑ and closed‑book settings, integrating RAG, question decomposition, inference‑time scaling, and self‑verification. A custom LLM‑as‑Judge replaces EM/ROUGE and off‑the‑shelf LLM graders, directly assessing factual grounding, logical consistency, and chain coherence, and revealing where current benchmarks under-measure reasoning quality.
  
        - **Benchmarks/Datasets:** FanOutQA, Musique, Frames, Quest.
        - **Stack:** LangGraph, AutoGen, LangChain.
        - **Techniques:** RAG, decomposition, inference‑time scaling, self‑verification loops  
        - **Datasets:** FanOutQA, MuSiQue, Frames, QUEST  
        - **Goal:** Beat SOTA and reveal current benchmark weaknesses.  
      

        <div class="flex justify-between items-baseline gap-2 mt-12 mb-2">
          <span class="font-bold text-[2rem]">InfoboxIQ: Text to Infobox synchronization (Wikipedia) — CoRAL Lab, ASU</span>
          <span class="font-bold text-[2rem] whitespace-nowrap">Feb 2025–Present</span>
        </div>
        A multi-stage LLM pipeline for information synchronization (text‑to‑table). Takes a Wikipedia article and its infobox template and produces an updated, evidence‑grounded infobox. We also introduce an evaluation suite verifies that the synchronized table is faithful, complete, and non‑hallucinatory.

        - **Pipeline (6–8 stages):** Preprocess, key/property breakdown, QA‑SRL extraction, KG triple generation, KG merge and conflict resolution, infobox creation.
        - **Dataset:** ~90K article–infobox pairs across ~40 Wikipedia categories with manually annotated key schemas.
        - **Evaluation:** per‑key accuracy, coverage/completeness, hallucination rate, overall text‑to‑table sync quality.
