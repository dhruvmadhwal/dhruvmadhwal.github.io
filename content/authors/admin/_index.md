      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
I'm a grad student at ASU's CoRAL Lab, building agentic AI and retrieval systems. I've worked on ML and data science projects at Samsung, Carelon, and several fast-paced startups, tackling problems across domains like healthcare analytics, recommendation systems, and consumer-focused technologies. Before ASU, I earned an MSc in Physics and BE in Electronics from BITS Pilani Goa, blending analytical rigor with technical expertise. I'm interested in both foundational AI research and its practical applications, and I'm actively looking for opportunities that bridge the two.
